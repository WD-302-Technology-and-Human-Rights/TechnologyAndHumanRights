The Internet has been a common ground for present-day criminals to utilize as a means to mobilize their malicious intentions, otherwise known as cybercrimes. Cybercrimes are illegal activities done using computers or the Internet. Their actors, known as cybercriminals, use different techniques to carry out their crimes, such as phishing, social engineering, and malware as part of their cyber attacks (Latto, 2022). One thing that people should know about such crimes is that they are not happening randomly at a time, cybercriminals are very intelligent, organized, and so professionalized which makes them more dangerous (Latto, 2022). As technology evolves, so do the cybercrimes that happen on the Internet. Cybercriminals have countless creative ways to attack their victims which is why Internet users have a duty and responsibility to stay informed and aware of such crimes to prevent their emergence. According to Carter (n.d.), the most common computer and internet cybercrimes in America include phishing, harassment, ransomware, prostitution, child pornography and solicitation, intellectual property theft, account hacking, drug trafficking, and credit card fraud. Seemingly, the situation on the said country does not fall far behind from the Philippines, and the situation remains alarming even when there is a law enacted to address and penalize cybercrimes (R.A. 10175 or the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012).
